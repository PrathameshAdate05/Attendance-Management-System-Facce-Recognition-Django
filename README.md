# Attendance Management System Using Python and DJango Framework

To identify the presence of the person is an important in various fields like college, hospital,
super market, hotel etc., In the past people were using muster or note book to take an attendance
of the employee in the company, attendance of the doctor in the hospital, attendance of the staff
in the super market and student attendance in the class room.
So here in this project we have shown a unique facial recognition based
biometric framework that records the presence subsequently.
